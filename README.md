# blodejs

Welcome to my playground! Blodejs is intended for my own learning and fun! 
Its a blogging platform build using Node and Koa, deployed on AWS using Travis and Beanstalk

As I plan to use it to publish my own blog, soon enough you can read more about blodejs on my website http://its-a-kind-of-magic.com/
