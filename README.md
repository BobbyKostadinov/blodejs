#BlodeJS

Welcome to my playground! Blodejs is intended for my own learning and fun! Its a blogging platform build using Node and Koa, deployed on AWS using Travis and Beanstalk

This is using:
https://github.com/BobbyKostadinov/react-koa-isomorphic-starter



As I plan to use it to publish my own blog, soon enough you can read more about blodejs on my website http://its-a-kind-of-magic.com/


## Usage

Development:
`npm install`
`gulp dev`

Production:
`npm install`
`npm start --harmony`

(Notice the harmony flag. For current Node version. 0.12.0 this is still required to run EC6 generators that KOA needs)
